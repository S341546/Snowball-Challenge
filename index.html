<p>
    We have chosen to create a product for students and teachers in Ethiopia. 
    We are based on schools in the country that have access to technology like the internet and a form of computer. 
    The internet gives the teacher easy access and it is not difficult to store and retrieve data. 
    This idea involves both students and teachers, as well as state officials to process data and people to help with contacting absent students.

    <p>
        The teacher is assigned a user on the website and logs in at the start of the class. 
        The first time in use, all current students are added to the system. 
        After a while we get enough data for the teacher to easily address the absence and get an overview of who is and is not present. 
        The data obtained would include students' names, which day the absence started, how long the student has been away and reason(s) for the absence. 
        Data on the student's health, both physically and mentally, will be collected.
        This is because there are both physical and mental reasons for not being able to go to school.
        Other personal information will be information about family and friends, as well as gender, age and class. 
        There are also problems that can prevent the student from attending school or to categorize more easily in a database. 
        This will give the teacher an easy way to take attendance (by filling in the table), but also give us an overview of the absence in the national database when uploaded. 
        Then the country will have a way to overview absences from their schools (both locally and nationally), map out trends and have an idea of which problem occurs most students.
        This information can be visualized by a table. They can now initiate preventive measures.
